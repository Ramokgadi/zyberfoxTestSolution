This is a maven project, please run mvn clean install  to install the plugins and build project, 
then you can run the build jar file or run spring-booot:run command to deploy the project locally

I would suggest download IntelliJ IDE to run the project then
  - open new project then select the pom.xml then open it as project to load everything
  - then you can use it pre-package maven  plugin to build and install the app
